I use TypeScript. I say that "I use TypeScript"
with a deep understanding of the relationship 
between JavaScript and TypeScript. I will talk
about this in depth and detail if asked. I also
have a deep understanding of JavaScript and its
unique runtime environments.

vim, tmux, git, and bash ☺

If you have never seen someone who is an advanced vim
user who edits texts at speeds MUCH higher than average
not just because I am typing fast but because everything
is scripted and automated using advanced vim scripting 
strategies integrated with bash, git, and tmux.

GCP and AWS are cool

amazon and google too much. $$

Cloud services are easy for me becasue of my strong scripting
skills and understanding of fundamentals of linux containers 
kubernetes, networks, and network security.
Although I pretty much avoid being on GCP and AWS as much as possible
on my own dime because I hate spending money
♣ ♣ ♣ ♣ ♣ ♣
Web services are intuitive if you have my skill set.

The cost $ is another reason why I love deploying angular apps.
ITS FREE FOR ME. As long as I can find free web servers.

I am T shaped for Angular Development
If I was T shaped for node.js development
I would choose Nestjs docker kubernetes cloud hosting etc.
